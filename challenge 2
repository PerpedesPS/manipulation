# Take the name of the user's favourite restaurant and store it in a variable called string_fav
string_fav = input("Please enter your favourite restaurant: ")

# Take in the user's favourite number and store it in an integer variable called int_fav
int_fav = int(input("Please enter your favourite number: "))

# Print out the name of the favourite restaurant and favourite number
print("Your favourite restaurant is:", string_fav)
print("Your favourite number is:", int_fav)

# Try to cast string_fav to an integer
int(string_fav)  # This will produce a ValueError

# In the line above, a ValueError will be raised because the value of string_fav is a string that represents the name of the user's favourite restaurant, not a valid integer. Therefore, it cannot be cast into an integer.
